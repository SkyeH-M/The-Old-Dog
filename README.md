# The Old Dog Bookshop

The Old Dog Bookshop website is designed to give potential customers informative about the shop. This means the site needs to be responsive, allowing visiters to view on any device without quality of experience suffering. The main focus of the site is to give viewers information such as location of the shop, and contact details.
